          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and results in an estimated $1.8 trillion
            in healthcare costs each year. Approximately 20% of patients lack a suitable saphenous vein for coronary
            artery bypass surgery, requiring use of small-diameter (&lt; 6 mm) vascular grafts made from synthetic or
            natural materials. However, synthetic grafts often fail due to thrombosis and poor patency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decellularized plant scaffolds offer a scalable, low-cost alternative due to their biocompatibility and
            structural similarity to native vessels. We hypothesize that optimized and preconditioned plant-derived
            grafts can support endothelialization, maintain mechanical stability, and reduce thrombosis, making them
            suitable for vascular implantation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this study, we optimized leatherleaf viburnum scaffolds for endothelial cell compatibility, mechanical
            strength, and minimal permeability. These grafts were then preconditioned with physiological pressure and
            flow in a custom-built bioreactor and evaluated in vitro and in vivo.
