          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Introduction:</strong> In recent years the use of decellularized plant tissue as a biomaterial has
            become more prevalent due to the remarkable similarities between plant and animal tissues. Decellularized
            plants have many advantages such as their availability, low cost, and eco-friendly nature of their
            production. Since the use of plant-derived materials for tissue engineering is so new, it is crucial to
            begin standardizing these products with the intention of clinical applications in the future. The goal of
            this study is to evaluate the differences in extracellular matrix structure between plant tissue
            decellularization techniques to determine the most appropriate method for the development of 3D vascular
            grafts.
