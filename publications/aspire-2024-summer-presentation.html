        <h1>Optimization of Plant-Derived Extracellular Matrix Structure and Mechanics for Vascular Repair</h1>

          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            With the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, there is an urgent need for the development of novel
            biomaterials for clinical applications. However, synthetic materials frequently fail when used for
            small-diameter vascular repair. Common issues include thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia, and, as with any
            biomaterial, immune rejection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, recent developments in bioengineering have enabled scientists to explore plant-based tissues
            as a solution. They can be engineered to have minimal plant DNA and seeded with the proper cells for
            implantation, lowering the chances of rejection. Since plant-based biomaterials are still new, research in
            this area remains limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            This summer, I began investigating methods that support the standardization of plant use in biomaterial
            engineering. I studied different decellularization detergents, enzyme conditions, time spent in necessary
            processing solutions, and sample collection locations. Differences and impacts were evaluated through
            tensile testing, histological processing, and image analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            As decellularization time was reduced, we observed less structural and mechanical damage to the plant
            extracellular matrix. Through optimization of these protocols, we aim to improve standardization of
            emerging plant-derived decellularization strategies for vascular repair.
