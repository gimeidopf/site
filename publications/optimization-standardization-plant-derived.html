          <p>
            Vascular graft failure rates remain unacceptably high due to thrombosis and poor integration, necessitating
            innovative solutions. This study optimized plant-derived extracellular matrix scaffolds as a scalable and
            biocompatible alternative to synthetic grafts and autologous vessels. We refined decellularization
            protocols to achieve >95% DNA removal while preserving mechanical properties comparable to native vessels,
            significantly enhancing endothelial cell seeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leatherleaf viburnum leaves were decellularized using sodium dodecyl sulfate-based and Trypsin/Tergitol-
            based treatments, achieved via clearing in bleach and Triton X-100 for 6 to 72 h. To assess the
            environmental influence on scaffold performance, leaves from multiple collection sites were processed using
            sodium dodecyl sulfate-based protocols. Scaffold performance was evaluated through tensile testing and
            histological analysis to assess structural integrity, while DNA quantification and endothelial cell
            recellularization measured biological compatibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated scaffolds with shorter clearing durations demonstrated the highest DNA
            removal (>=95%) while preserving mechanical properties, significantly outperforming Trypsin/Tergitol
            treatments. Longer clearing times reduced fiber diameter by 60%, compromising scaffold strength. Shorter
            clearing times preserved extracellular matrix integrity and significantly improved endothelial cell seeding
            efficiency. Larger leaves supported significantly higher endothelial cell densities than smaller leaves,
            highlighting the need for standardized material sources. Permeability tests demonstrated minimal leakage at
            120 mmHg and structural stability under dynamic flow conditions, suggesting their suitability for vascular
            applications. These findings establish a reliable framework for optimizing plant-derived grafts, improving
            their reproducibility and performance for tissue engineering applications.
